Introduction 
What is Strategic and Tactical Marketing in marketing Plan??
Marketing plan consist of two components below:
What the supplier is particularly suitable to offer customer (SWOT)
What are consumer needs and desire (Market research & Survey)
Strategic Marketing :
Strategic Marketing plan involves two Key decisions : 
1.	Knowing the customer whom to go for (segmentation & Marketing)
2.	Which image of the organization to be created in the market (Positioning)
After Strategic Planning, Tactical Planning starts It usually covers 4 areas :
1.Product: Development & Modification of product in view of target segment.
2.Price: In view of cost, competition and willingness to pay by target segment.
3.Place: Selection of most suitable channel/ place to reach the target segment
4. Promotion: communication of the offer in an appealing way to target segment.
Tactical Plan is dependent on Strategic plan, Strategic Plan is not dependent on Tactical Plan
Asymmetry of Strategic and Tactical marketing
 

Market Segmentation 
Definition
Market segmentation means cutting markets into slices. Ideally, consumers
belonging to the same market segments – or sets of buyers  are very similar to one another with respect to the consumer characteristics deemed critical by management. At the same time, optimally, consumers belonging to different market segments are very different from one another with respect to those consumer characteristics. Consumer characteristics deemed critical to market segmentation by management are referred to as segmentation criteria.
Benefits 
1.Micromarketing or hyper-segmentation :offer a customised product or service to very small groups of consumers.
2.Finer segmentation :databases enabling providers of products and services to learn from a person’s
purchase history about what to offer them next.
3.For small organisations, it simplifies lack the financial resources to serve a larger market or multiple
market segments
4.sales management and Team Building

Market Segment Analysis
The process of grouping consumers into naturally existing or artificially created segments of consumers who share similar product preferences or characteristics.
The layers of MSA:
 



Approaches to MSA:
1.Based on organizational Constraints
segment revolution or quantitative survey-based segmentation approach tends to be seen as the proto typical market segmentation analysis. The key assumption underlying this approach is that the organisation conducting market segmentation analysis is willing and able to start from scratch; to forget entirely about how its marketing was conducted in the past, and commence the segmentation process with a genuinely open mind. If market segmentation analysis reveals a promising niche segment, or a promising set of market segments to target with a differentiated market strategy, the organisation must develop an entirely new marketing plan in view of those findings.
2.Based on choice of Segmentation variables.
Based on the nature of consumer characteristics used to extract market segments.When one single segmentation variable is used, the segmentation approach is referred to as a priori /convenience-group /commonsense market segmentation and which exploits multiple segmentation variables, is referred to as a posteriori/cluster based / post hoc segmentation / data-driven segmentation
Data Structure and data-driven MSA
3 possible conceptual approaches to data-driven market segmentation: natural, reproducible or constructive segmentation
Natural segmentation reflects the traditional view that distinct market segments exist in the data, and that the aim of market segmentation analysis is to find them. 
Reproducible segmentation refers to the case where natural market segments do not exist in the data. But the data are not entirely unstructured either. Rather, the data contain some structure – other than cluster structure – making it possible to generate the same segmentation solution repeatedly. The ability to repeatedly reveal the same or very similar market segments, makes results of data-driven segmentation studies less random and more reliable. 
Constructive segmentation refers to the case where neither cluster structure nor any other data structure exists, which would enable the data analyst to reproduce similar segmentation solutions repeatedly across replications.




MSA Step by Step
 




Step 1: Deciding (not) to Segment
Implications of Committing to Market Segmentation
The key implication is that the organisation needs to commit to the segmentation strategy on the long term. The commitment to market segmentation goes hand in hand with the willingness and ability of the organisation to make substantial changes and investments. Potentially required changes include the development of new products, the modification of existing products, changes in pricing and distribution channels used to sell the product, as well as all communications with the market.
Implementation Barriers
Senior management
Lack of leadership, pro-active championing, commitment and involvement in the market segmentation process by senior leadership undermines the success of market segmentation.
Organisational culture.
Lack of market or consumer orientation, resistance to change and new ideas, lack of creative thinking, bad communication and lack of sharing of information and insights across organisational units, short-term thinking, unwillingness to make changes and office politics have been identified as preventing the successful implementation of market segmentation
Lack of training
If senior management and the team tasked with segmentation do not understand the very foundations of market segmentation, or if they are unaware of the consequences of pursuing such a strategy, the attempt of introducing market segmentation is likely to fail.

Step 2: Specifying the Ideal Target Segment
1. Segment Evaluation Criteria
It is important to understand that – for a market segmentation analysis to produce results that are useful to an organisation – user input cannot be limited to either a briefing at the start of the process, or the development of a marketing mix at the end.
 Knock-Out Criteria
Knock-out criteria are used to determine if market segments resulting from the market segmentation analysis qualify to be assessed using segment attractiveness criteria. The segment must be homogeneous, distinct, large enough, matching the strengths of the organisation, identifiable, reachable .Knock-out criteria must be understood by senior management, the segmentation team, and the advisory committee. Most of them do not require further specification, but some do.

Step 3: Collecting Data
Segmentation Variables
Throughout this book we use the term segmentation variable to refer to the variable in the empirical data used in common sense segmentation to split the sample into market segments.In common sense segmentation, the segmentation variable is typically one single characteristic of the consumers in the sample.
Segmentation Criteria
Geographic Segmentation
Socio-Demographic Segmentation
Psychographic Segmentation
Behavioural Segmentation
 Data from Survey Studies
Most market segmentation analyses are based on survey data. Survey data is cheap and easy to collect, making it a feasible approach for any organisation.
A few key aspects that need to be considered when using survey data are below
Choice of Variables, Response Options, Response Styles, Sample Size, Data from Internal Sources, Data from Experimental Studies

Step 4: Exploring Data
Data exploration helps to
(1) identify the measurement levels of the variables 
(2) investigate the univariate distributions of each of the Variables 
(3) assess dependency structures between variables. 
In addition, data may need to be pre-processed and prepared so it can be used as input for
different segmentation algorithms. Results from the data exploration stage provide
insights into the suitability of different segmentation methods for extracting market
segments.
